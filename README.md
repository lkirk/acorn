A C implementation of the ACORN PRNG.

Implemented as described on the [acorn
site](https://acorn.wikramaratna.org/index.html). For more info on PRNGs, see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators)

Still needs testing and verification, I just wanted to implement a continuous,
uniform PRNG so that I could implement stats functions that derive from
transformed uniforms.
